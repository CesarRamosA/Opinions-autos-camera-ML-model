       "' Where to begin I bought this car on the recommendation of a friend who has a pretty serious love affair with Volvo cars  For the first 5   6 months  the car was fine  But then   Paint Chips  Within the first 10 months  I noticed dime sized paint chips on the front of the car  Unfortunately  I didn t purchase the clear coat auto bra at the time of original purchase  To me  this was totally unacceptable  I took it to my dealer and had to argue with the service director to get it fixed  paint is not warranted  In fact  they wouldn t fix it at first  It was only when I responded to the Volvo service survey with my dissatisfaction that they agreed to fix the paint chips  During my original conversations with Curtis at Rickenbaugh Volvo  he indicated that the problem was likely my fault  asking if I follow other cars too closely Headlights  The headlights go out about every 6 months  Annoying Brakes  The car was in for work on the brakes twice within 34K miles  The power assist on the brakes failed at 15K miles  not so good when you live in the mountains  Then  the rear pads wore out at about 30K miles  Rickenbaugh Volvo Service  Mark or Jim  quoted me  460 to replace the rear brakes  A service guy in Vail  where everything is TWICE as expensive as the real world  charged me  180  and  he told me that I could drive at least another 5K miles on what I had   Volvo made it sound like my car would be unfit for the roads unless I had the brakes replaced immediately Check Engine light  The Check Engine light came on randomly during the two years that I had the car  This light required me to take the car in for service twice Service light  The service light comes on every 7 500 miles  ANNOYING  Last time I took the car in  I asked them to permanently disable the light or set it at 30 000 miles  They said they couldn t do that  which I don t really believe  I mean  c mon  you can disable you Daytime Running Lights and your airbags  but you can t disable the Service light Road Noise  Sounds like your drag racing a Mack Truck when you are on the highway  I took a roadtrip with a friend once  and the wind and road noise on the passenger side were so unbearable  that we had to stuff pillows up against the passenger window to buffer the noise Tires  I needed new tires way too early  25   30K miles  I rotate and balance my tires religiously Back hatch  The plastic molded rear hatch is supposed to be black  After about 10 months  it had oxidized to a cloudy gray  It looked bad  And  the button you press to open the hatch was cracked  I estimate in about another year  it will break off completely Handling in Snow  Forget about it  This car was sold to me as a car that would perform well in the snow  I ve never gotten stuck  but I have definitely had some concerns on snowy days  Bottom line  The car was in for service 7 times in two years  Twice  the Volvo dealer  Rickenbaugh Volvo in Denver  made a smirky  smart alek comment about how the problems were the fault of my driving  paint chips  I must follow too closely  Brakes pads wearing out  I must brake too hard  Funny  I never had problems like that with the previous cars I ve owned  a Honda Civic for seven years and a Chevy Blaze for three years Gimme a break  I wouldn t recommend this car  any Volvo  or Rickenbaugh to my worst enemy The best part of the story is that on the last service survey  I gave Volvo Rickenbaugh the poorest rating possible  and they never called me back  I guess they are content to just blow off my bad experience Really  it no longer matters  I traded in this unreliable and chattering car for a Honda just this week  '"
